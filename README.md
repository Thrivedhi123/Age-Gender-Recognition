# Real-Time Age and Gender Detection

This project detects faces and predicts age and gender in real-time using OpenCV's deep learning module. It uses pre-trained DNN models for face detection, age classification, and gender classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Features

- Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV DNN.
- Predicts age and gender from detected faces.
- Uses a rolling history buffer for stable predictions.
- Displays results directly on the video feed.
